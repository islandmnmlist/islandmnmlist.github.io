It seems that minimalists inevitably start a blog, so here's my blog.

# Brief Context
I started intentionally "becoming a minimalist" the second half of 2015. It became a big focus of mine after we finished moving into our new house. Ironically, it was the first time in my life I haven't rented a house/apartment; the prospect of having to move again in the near future finally became a thing of the past. Before that, I'd moved all my possessions at least a dozen times, from my parents house to college, to countless rented apartments, then a few rented houses, etc.

I've read the KonMari book (TODO: ADD LINK) as well as countless blogs on minimalism (TODO: ADD LINKS), so I will probably use 'KM' and 'minimize' interchangeably.

# Stuff I've already minimized
- clothes
- books
- DVDs/CDs
- electronics (devices, cords, etc.)
- digital clutter (also wrote a blog on the topic)
- desk

# Stuff I still need to minimize
- vitamins / supplements
- photos (need to buy a scanner)
- documents (need to buy a scanner)
- living room

# Benefits I'm noticing
- I'm reading more (and actually _finishing_ books)
- More time to ponder life

# Currently reading
