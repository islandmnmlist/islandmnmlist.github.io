It seems that minimalists inevitably start a blog, so here's my blog.

# Brief Context
I started intentionally "becoming a minimalist" the second half of 2015. It became a big focus of mine after we finished moving into our new house. Ironically, it was the first time in my life I haven't rented a house/apartment; the prospect of having to move again in the near future finally became a thing of the past. Before that, I'd moved all my possessions at least a dozen times, from my parents house to college, to countless rented apartments, then a few rented houses, etc.

(I've read ["The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up"](http://tidyingup.com/books/the-life-changing-magic-of-tidying-up-hc) by Marie Kondo as well as lots of blogs on minimalism (http://mnmlist.com, http://www.becomingminimalist.com/, http://bemorewithless.com)/, so I may use 'KM' and 'minimize' interchangeably.)

# Stuff I've minimized
- clothes
- books
- DVDs/CDs
- electronics (devices, cords, etc.)
- digital clutter (also wrote a blog on the topic)
- desk / work environment

# Stuff I still need to minimize
- vitamins / supplements
- photos (need to buy a scanner)
- documents (need to buy a scanner)
- living room (too many things in it still, drives me crazy)

# Benefits I'm noticing
- I'm reading more (and actually _finishing_ books)
- More time to ponder life
- I don't _want_ stuff anymore. (Besides a photo scanner and a boat). I'm much more content with what I already have.
